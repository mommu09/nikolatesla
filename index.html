            <h2>About Tesla</h2>
            <p>
                Nikola Tesla ( 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[3][4] engineer, futurist, and
                inventor. He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC)
                electricity supply system.<br>
                In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[40] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.[41] They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.
